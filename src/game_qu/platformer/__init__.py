"""This is a module with some code for platformer games. You can modify all constants to make it feel like how you want.
This module does not use calculus to calculate the physics because it simplifies the code structure and makes the overall
code more clean and less prone to bugs. It uses a linear approximation, which is close enough for almost all scenarios.
On most machines the game should run at 120+ frames per second, so that small approximation error will not make a difference.
Slow running times will not affect any code in this module, but it could affect your game in more niche cases. If that calculus
bit does not make sense, then do not worry about it. It is nearly guaranteed it will not affect your game."""
